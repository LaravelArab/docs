## Introduction

Laravel is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with PHPUnit is included out of the box and a `phpunit.xml` file is already setup for your application. The framework also ships with convenient helper methods that allow you to expressively test your applications.

By default, your application's `tests` directory contains two directories: `Feature` and `Unit`. Unit tests are tests that focus on a very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus on a single method. Feature tests may test a larger portion of your code, including how several objects interact with each other or even a full HTTP request to a JSON endpoint.

An `ExampleTest.php` file is provided in both the `Feature` and `Unit` test directories. After installing a new Laravel application, simply run `phpunit` on the command line to run your tests.

## Environment

When running tests via `phpunit`, Laravel will automatically set the configuration environment to `testing` because of the environment variables defined in the `phpunit.xml` file. Laravel also automatically configures the session and cache to the `array` driver while testing, meaning no session or cache data will be persisted while testing.

You are free to define other testing environment configuration values as necessary. The `testing` environment variables may be configured in the `phpunit.xml` file, but make sure to clear your configuration cache using the `config:clear` Artisan command before running your tests!

## Creating & Running Tests

To create a new test case, use the `make:test` Artisan command:

    // Create a test in the Feature directory...
    php artisan make:test UserTest

    // Create a test in the Unit directory...
    php artisan make:test UserTest --unit

Once the test has been generated, you may define test methods as you normally would using PHPUnit. To run your tests, simply execute the `phpunit` command from your terminal:

    <?php

    namespace Tests\Unit;

    use Tests\TestCase;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseTransactions;

    class ExampleTest extends TestCase
    {
        /**
         * A basic test example.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function testBasicTest()
        {
            $this->assertTrue(true);
        }
    }

> {note} If you define your own `setUp` method within a test class, be sure to call `parent::setUp()`.
